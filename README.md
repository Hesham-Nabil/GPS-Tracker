The goal of this project is to develop an embedded system using C programming that
gathers real-time positional coordinates while a microcontroller is in motion (GPS tracking
system using TM4C123G LaunchPad) after power-on until a destination point is reached.
The collected data will then be efficiently transferred to a personal computer (PC) and
visualized on a map application.

Project Requirements:
    Hardware:
              1. A microcontroller development board (e.g., TivaC)
              2. A GPS module (or a compatible sensor that provides positional data)
              3. A personal computer (PC)
              4. Connecting cables (USB, serial, etc.)
    Software:
              5. A C-development environment (e.g., Keil)
              6. A PC-based application development environment suitable for data
              visualization (e.g., Python with Matplotlib or a mapping API)
